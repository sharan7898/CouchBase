## Introduction to CouchBase

Couchbase Server is an open-source, distributed, multi-model NoSQL, JSON document database that is enhanced for interactive applications. 

It is also known as Membase. It was developed by Couchbase, Inc. and initially released in August 2010.

It is written using C++, Erlang, C, Go languages.

Its server is designed to provide us with easy-to-scale key-value or JSON document access with high sustained throughput and low latency.

These applications may help in serving many users by storing, creating, aggregating, retrieving, manipulating and presenting data. 

## Why CouchBase

CouchBase is widely  used for its feauters such as:-

* It is an open-source NoSQL database that provides us with a mechanism for storage and recovery of data which is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

* It is useful as it is optimized for interactive applications.

* It has schema-free Data Schema.

* It has multiple data access paths to query and manage our JSON documents.

* It supports Declarative Query Language (N1QL) that extends ANSI SQL to JSON.

* It has predefined data types such as boolean, string, number, etc.

* The primary database model for Couchbase is Document Store.

* The secondary database model for Couchbase is Key-Value Store.

* It supports XML data format.

* In Couchbase, the partitioning can be done by Sharding.

* It has in-memory capabilities.

* It provides ACID transaction concepts.

* It also supports secondary indexes without any restrictions.

* It has functions and timers in JavaScript for Server-side scripts.

## Difference Between RDBMS VS CouchBase

**1.RDBMS**

RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management Systems. 

It is most popular database. In it data is store in the form of row that is in the form of tuple. 

It contain numbers of table and data can be easily access because data is store in the table.

**2.CouchBase**

Couchbase Server is an open-source, distributed multi-model NoSQL document-oriented database software package that is optimized for interactive applications. 

It is also known as Membase. 

It was developed by Couchbase, Inc. and initially released on August 2010.

## Advantages of CouchBase

* **High Performance and Scalability**: Couchbase is designed for high-performance, low-latency applications. It utilizes an in-memory caching model that allows for fast data access. Additionally, Couchbase's distributed architecture enables seamless scalability, allowing you to easily add more nodes to handle increasing data and traffic.

* **Flexible Data Model**: Couchbase offers a flexible data model with support for JSON documents. This allows you to store and query structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data without the need for rigid schemas. The flexible data model is particularly beneficial for applications that have evolving data requirements or require schema-less storage.

* **Full-Text Search Capabilities**: Couchbase provides built-in full-text search functionality. This feature allows you to perform complex searches across your data without the need for external search engines. It supports features like fuzzy matching, term boosting, and relevance ranking, enabling powerful search capabilities within your application.

* **High Availability and Data Durability**: Couchbase ensures high availability and data durability through built-in data replication and automatic failover mechanisms. It replicates data across nodes, ensuring that even in the event of node failures, your data remains accessible and your application can continue to operate.

* **Mobile Integration**: Couchbase offers seamless integration with mobile platforms through its embedded database called Couchbase Lite. It allows you to build mobile applications with offline capabilities and real-time data synchronization. Changes made on mobile devices can be synchronized with the Couchbase Server when connectivity is available.

* **Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Support**: Couchbase supports deployment across multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments. This flexibility allows you to build hybrid cloud architectures and take advantage of multi-cloud strategies. Couchbase provides features like cross-data center replication and data tiering, enabling data distribution and efficient resource utilization.
